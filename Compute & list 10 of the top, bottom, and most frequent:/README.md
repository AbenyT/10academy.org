Overview
This script is designed to load, preprocess, and analyze customer network experience data from a CSV file. It focuses on handling missing values and identifying key statistics (top, bottom, and most frequent values) for critical network metrics such as TCP Retransmission, RTT (Round-Trip Time), and Throughput. The results provide valuable insights into the distribution and commonality of these metrics, aiding in data-driven decision-making.

Features
Data Loading: Reads data from a specified CSV file.
Missing Values Handling: Replaces missing numerical values with their respective means.
Statistical Analysis: Computes and lists the top 10, bottom 10, and most frequent 10 values for key metrics.
User-Friendly Output: Displays the initial dataset and analysis results in the console.
Libraries Used
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations and handling data transformations.
Input Data
The script expects a CSV file containing customer network experience data with the following columns:

customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer.
tcp_retransmission: Numerical data representing TCP retransmission counts.
rtt: Numerical data representing Round-Trip Time in milliseconds.
throughput: Numerical data representing network throughput in Mbps.
handset_type: Categorical data indicating the type of handset used by the customer.
Note: Ensure that the CSV file contains these columns or adjust the script accordingly to match your dataset's column names.

Preprocessing Steps
Data Loading:

The script attempts to load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
If the file is not found at the specified path, it notifies the user to check the file path.
Handling Missing Values:

Numerical Columns:
tcp_retransmission, rtt, and throughput columns have their missing values filled with the mean of their respective columns.
Categorical Columns:
handset_type column has its missing values filled with the mode (most frequent value).
Statistical Analysis:

For each numerical column (tcp_retransmission, rtt, throughput), the script computes:
Top 10 Values: The highest 10 values in the column.
Bottom 10 Values: The lowest 10 values in the column.
Most Frequent 10 Values: The 10 most frequently occurring values in the column.
Instructions to Run
Install Required Libraries:

Ensure that you have pandas and numpy installed. If not, install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy
Update File Paths:

Input CSV File: Modify the file_path variable in the script to point to the location of your input CSV file.
Output (Optional): If you intend to save the analysis results to a file, you can extend the script accordingly. Currently, the script prints the results to the console.
Run the Script:

Execute the script in your preferred Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, PyCharm, or the command line).

View the Results:

The script will display:

Notes
Column Names:

Ensure that the column names in your CSV file match those used in the script (customer_id, tcp_retransmission, rtt, throughput, handset_type). If your dataset has different column names, adjust the script accordingly.

Handling Ties in Mode:

The script uses mode()[0] to handle cases where there might be multiple modes. This approach selects the first mode in case of ties.

Scalability:

For large datasets, printing extensive outputs (like the top and bottom 10 values for multiple columns) can clutter the console. Consider redirecting outputs to a file or implementing logging for better manageability.

Extending Analysis:

The script currently prints results to the console. You can extend it to save the analysis results to separate CSV files or generate visualizations for a more comprehensive analysis.

Error Handling:

The script includes basic error handling for file not found scenarios. For more robust applications, consider adding additional error checks (e.g., validating data types, ensuring required columns exist).

Performance Optimization:

If working with very large datasets, optimize performance by minimizing in-memory operations or using more efficient data processing libraries.

Customization:

The function get_top_bottom_most_frequent is generic and can be reused for any numerical column by simply passing the column name. You can modify the number of top/bottom/frequent values by adjusting the function parameters.
