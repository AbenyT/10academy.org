Project Overview
This project is designed to analyze throughput data from different handset types. The code provided performs the following operations:

Data Loading: Loads a CSV dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values in the 'throughput' column by replacing them with the column's mean value.
Data Aggregation: Computes the average throughput for each handset type.
Data Visualization: Visualizes the distribution of average throughput per handset type using a bar plot.
Prerequisites
To run this script, you'll need the following Python libraries installed:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
seaborn: For enhanced plotting capabilities.
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Files
your_file_name.csv: This is the dataset used in this analysis. Replace your_file_name.csv with the actual name of your file.
Setup Instructions
Download Dataset: Place your dataset in the specified file path or modify the file_path variable to point to your CSV file location.

Code Execution: Run the code either in a Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook, or a script runner (like VSCode or any other Python IDE).

Code Explanation
1. Import Libraries
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
These are the required libraries for data handling, analysis, and visualization.
2. Load Dataset
python
Copy code
file_path = r'D:\10 Acadamy kifiya\Technical Content\data\Week1_challenge_data_source(CSV)\your_file_name.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
The dataset is loaded from the provided file path.
3. Handle Missing Values
python
Copy code
df['throughput'] = df['throughput'].fillna(df['throughput'].mean())
Missing values in the 'throughput' column are replaced with the mean throughput.
4. Compute Average Throughput Per Handset Type
python
Copy code
avg_throughput_per_handset = df.groupby('handset_type')['throughput'].mean().reset_index()
The average throughput is computed for each handset type.
5. Sort and Display the Results
python
Copy code
avg_throughput_per_handset = avg_throughput_per_handset.sort_values(by='throughput', ascending=False)
print(avg_throughput_per_handset.head())
The results are sorted by throughput in descending order for clarity.
6. Visualize the Data
python
Copy code
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.barplot(x='throughput', y='handset_type', data=avg_throughput_per_handset, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Average Throughput per Handset Type')
plt.xlabel('Average Throughput')
plt.ylabel('Handset Type')
plt.show()
A bar plot is generated to visually represent the average throughput per handset type.
Customization
Dataset Path: Change the file_path variable to the location of your CSV file.
Visualization Settings: Adjust the figsize, palette, or axis labels to modify the appearance of the plot.
Output
Console: Displays the first few rows of average throughput per handset type.
Plot: A bar chart showing the distribution of average throughput per handset type.
