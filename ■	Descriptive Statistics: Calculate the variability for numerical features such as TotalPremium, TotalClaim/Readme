# Machine Learning Rating Data Analysis

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing insurance policy and vehicle-related data. The analysis includes data summarization, descriptive statistics, and calculating variability for numerical features such as `TotalPremium`, `TotalClaims`, and other key attributes.

## Project Structure

- `MachineLearningRating_v3.txt`: The dataset file that contains insurance and vehicle data.
- `eda_analysis.py`: The Python script that performs EDA, including descriptive statistics and variability calculations.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6+
- Pandas library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
Dataset
The dataset is a pipe-delimited text file (MachineLearningRating_v3.txt) with the following columns:

Script Details
The eda_analysis.py script performs the following:

Data Loading:

Loads the dataset from MachineLearningRating_v3.txt.
Data Preview:

Displays the first few rows to understand the structure of the dataset.
Data Summary:

Outputs information about the dataset, including the data types and non-null counts.
Descriptive Statistics:

Provides descriptive statistics such as count, mean, min, max, and quartiles for numerical columns (TotalPremium, TotalClaims, etc.).
Variability:

Calculates the variance and standard deviation for numerical columns.
Missing Values:

Identifies any missing values in the dataset.
Usage
Run the Python Script: To perform EDA, simply run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:Dataset Preview:
