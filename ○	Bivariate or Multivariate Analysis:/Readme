# Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis of Machine Learning Dataset

This repository contains a Python script that performs bivariate and multivariate analysis on the dataset `MachineLearningRating_v3.txt`. The analysis focuses on exploring the relationships between `TotalPremium` and `TotalClaims` as a function of `PostalCode`, using scatter plots and correlation matrices.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: `MachineLearningRating_v3.txt`
- **Delimiter**: Pipe (`|`)

### Column Types
- **Numerical Columns**: `TotalPremium`, `TotalClaims`
- **Categorical Column**: `PostalCode`

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Libraries Used:
pandas: To load and manipulate the dataset.
matplotlib: To create plots.
seaborn: To style and generate scatter plots and correlation matrices.
Project Structure
bivariate_multivariate_analysis.py: The main Python script that performs the analysis.
MachineLearningRating_v3.txt: The dataset used for analysis (this file should be in the same directory as the script).
How to Run the Script
Download the dataset: Place MachineLearningRating_v3.txt in the same folder as the script.

Run the script:python bivariate_multivariate_analysis.py
View Output: The script will generate scatter plots and a correlation matrix and display them one by one.

Example Usagepython bivariate_multivariate_analysis.py
After running, you will see:

Scatter Plot: Relationship between TotalPremium and TotalClaims, colored by PostalCode.
Correlation Matrix: A heatmap showing the correlation between TotalPremium and TotalClaims.
Functions
plot_scatter(df, x_col, y_col, hue_col): Plots a scatter plot of x_col vs y_col, colored by hue_col.
plot_correlation_matrix(df, cols): Plots a heatmap of the correlation matrix for specified numerical columns.
Customization
You can modify the appearance of the plots by adjusting parameters in seaborn.scatterplot() and seaborn.heatmap() in the script. For example, change color palettes or add additional visual elements.

Future Enhancements
Add interaction to scatter plots (e.g., using Plotly).
Explore additional relationships or include more variables in the analysis.
Implement statistical tests to validate observed relationships.
