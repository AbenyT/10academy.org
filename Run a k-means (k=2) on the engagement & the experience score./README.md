Overview
This project demonstrates how to use K-Means Clustering to group data points based on two features: engagement_score and experience_score. The project uses Scikit-learn for clustering, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pip package manager
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
Install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have the requirements.txt file, manually install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Dataset
This project uses a sample CSV dataset located at 'D:/10 Acadamy kifiya/Technical Content/data/Week1_challenge_data_source(CSV)'. You should replace this path with the path to your actual dataset. The dataset must include the following columns:

engagement_score
experience_score
These features are used for clustering, and rows with missing values in these columns will be removed.

How to Run the Code
Set up the dataset: Make sure your dataset is formatted correctly and placed in the file path you specify. Update the file_path variable in the script with the correct location.

Run the script:

Execute the Python script using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python <script_name>.py
The script will:

Load the dataset and preprocess it by removing rows with missing values.
Use K-Means Clustering to group the data into two clusters (k=2).
Visualize the clusters on a 2D scatter plot with Seaborn.
Optionally, save the clustered data into a CSV file.
Visualize the Output:

After running the script, the output visualization will show a scatter plot of the engagement and experience scores, color-coded by cluster.

You can save the clustered data by setting the output_path variable to your desired location.

Customization
Number of Clusters: You can adjust the number of clusters k by modifying the n_clusters parameter in the KMeans function:

python
Copy code
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
Dataset Path: Replace the file_path variable with the path to your dataset.

Save Path: Modify the output_path variable to change where the clustered CSV file is saved.

Files
script_name.py: The main Python script that handles data loading, clustering, and visualization.
clustered_engagement_experience.csv (optional): The CSV file containing the original data along with the assigned clusters.
Visualization
The script uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the results. The clusters are plotted using a scatter plot where:

X-axis: Engagement Score
Y-axis: Experience Score
Colors represent different clusters.
