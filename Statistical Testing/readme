Insurance Data Analysis and Chi-Square Test README
Overview
This project analyzes an insurance dataset, performing statistical tests and generating visualizations to understand the relationships between the categorical variables "Province," "Gender," and the target variable "Claimed." It includes chi-square tests to examine the association between the features and claims, as well as visualizations to explore the distribution of claims across provinces and genders.

Files
insurance_data.csv: The dataset used in the analysis (not provided; you must ensure this file is available).
analysis_script.py: The Python script that contains the code for loading the data, performing chi-square tests, and creating visualizations.
Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and loading the dataset.
numpy: Used for numeric computations (although not heavily used in this script).
scipy: For conducting statistical tests, such as the chi-squared test.
matplotlib: For plotting the visualizations.
seaborn: For creating count plots.
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn
Usage
1. Loading the Dataset
The script loads the dataset from a CSV file (insurance_data.csv). Ensure that this file is in the same directory as the script before running.

python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv('insurance_data.csv')
2. Data Exploration
The script prints the first few rows of the dataset, basic information, summary statistics, and unique value counts for each column.

python
Copy code
print(df.head())
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())
for column in df.columns:
    print(df[column].value_counts())
3. Chi-Square Test
The chi-square test is used to assess whether there is a significant relationship between categorical variables:

Province vs Claimed: Are claims dependent on the province?
Gender vs Claimed: Are claims dependent on gender?
The chi-squared test results include both the chi-squared statistic and the p-value for each test.

python
Copy code
chi2_province, p_province = stats.chi2_contingency(pd.crosstab(df['Province'], df['Claimed']))[:2]
chi2_gender, p_gender = stats.chi2_contingency(pd.crosstab(df['Gender'], df['Claimed']))[:2]

print(f"Province vs Claimed: chi2 = {chi2_province:.4f}, p-value = {p_province:.4f}")
print(f"Gender vs Claimed: chi2 = {chi2_gender:.4f}, p-value = {p_gender:.4f}")
4. Data Visualization
The script generates two count plots using seaborn to visualize the relationships between:

Claims by Province: Shows the number of claims across different provinces.
Claims by Gender: Shows the number of claims for each gender.
python
Copy code
sns.countplot(data=df, x='Province', hue='Claimed')
sns.countplot(data=df, x='Gender', hue='Claimed')
How to Run
Ensure the dataset (insurance_data.csv) is in the same folder as the script.
Run the script in a Python environment:
bash
Copy code
python analysis_script.py
The script will output:
Summary statistics and unique value counts.
Chi-squared test results for "Province vs Claimed" and "Gender vs Claimed."
Two visual plots showing the distribution of claims by province and gender.
Example Output
After running the script, you will see:

Chi-squared test results: Indicating whether there is a significant relationship between "Province" and "Claimed" or "Gender" and "Claimed."
Visualizations: Two bar plots showing the distribution of claims for different provinces and genders.
Next Steps
Modeling: You can use this analysis to inform machine learning models by including the most statistically relevant features.
Additional Features: Extend the analysis to other variables in the dataset or perform more complex visualizations.
