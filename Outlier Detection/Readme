Machine Learning Rating Analysis
Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset containing insurance and vehicle information. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), focusing on outlier detection using box plots.

Dataset
The dataset is stored in a file named MachineLearningRating_v3.txt, which contains various columns related to insurance policies, vehicles, and financial details.

StatutoryClass: Statutory class of the insurance.
StatutoryRiskType: Statutory risk type.
TotalPremium: Total premium amount.
TotalClaims: Total number of claims.
Outlier Detection
The provided script includes a section for detecting outliers using box plots. Box plots are used to visualize the distribution of numerical data and highlight any outliers.

Python Script
The Python script performs the following tasks:

Load the Dataset: Reads the dataset from MachineLearningRating_v3.txt.
Preprocess Data: Converts the TransactionMonth column to datetime format.
Outlier Detection: Creates box plots for numerical columns to detect outliers.
Script
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
file_path = 'MachineLearningRating_v3.txt'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path, delimiter='|')

# Convert 'TransactionMonth' to datetime
data['TransactionMonth'] = pd.to_datetime(data['TransactionMonth'])

# List of numerical columns for outlier detection
numerical_columns = [
    'RegistrationYear', 'cubiccapacity', 'kilowatts', 'CustomValueEstimate', 
    'CapitalOutstanding', 'SumInsured', 'CalculatedPremiumPerTerm', 'TotalPremium'
]

# Initialize the figure for box plots
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 10))

# Plot box plots for each numerical column to detect outliers
for i, column in enumerate(numerical_columns, 1):
    plt.subplot(3, 3, i)
    sns.boxplot(x=data[column])
    plt.title(f'Box Plot of {column}')
    plt.xlabel(column)

# Adjust layout to prevent overlap
plt.tight_layout()

# Show the plots
plt.show()
Requirements
Pandas: pip install pandas
Matplotlib: pip install matplotlib
Seaborn: pip install seaborn
Usage
Ensure the dataset file MachineLearningRating_v3.txt is in the same directory as the script.
Run the script using Python.
sh
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Review the generated box plots to identify any outliers in the numerical data.
