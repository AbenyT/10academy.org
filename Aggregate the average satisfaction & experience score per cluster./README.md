This script performs K-Means clustering on a dataset containing engagement, experience, and satisfaction scores, assuming the data is stored in a CSV file. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Import Libraries:
pandas is used for data manipulation, and KMeans from sklearn.cluster is for clustering.

Loading Data:
The dataset is loaded from the specified path using pd.read_csv().

Data Cleaning:
Any rows with missing values in the 'engagement_score', 'experience_score', or 'satisfaction_score' columns are dropped.

Feature Selection:
The relevant features for clustering are selected: 'engagement_score' and 'experience_score'.

K-Means Clustering:
K-Means is applied with n_clusters=2 (i.e., dividing the data into two clusters). The fit_predict method assigns each data point to one of the clusters.

Cluster Aggregation:
After clustering, the mean values of the 'satisfaction_score', 'experience_score', and 'engagement_score' are calculated for each cluster.

Output:
The aggregated cluster results are printed and optionally saved to a CSV file.

Suggestions/Notes:
If needed, ensure the path to your dataset and the output CSV are correct.
You could experiment with different values for n_clusters if 2 is not optimal for your use case.
This script provides a simple and clear way to segment your data based on engagement and experience scores, while also summarizing satisfaction levels for each group.
